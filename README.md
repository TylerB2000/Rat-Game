# Rat-Game

Rat Game is a text-based, terminal-based, RPG. Rat Game was completely coded in Python3

In Rat Game you play as a hero tasked with making their way through a dungeon full of various creatures. 
Once you start the game you will be asked for a name for your hero and what weapon to equip them with. 
This weapon can be a choice between a dagger, a sword, or an axe (each with their own unique stats).

Once you have chosen your weapon you will be faced with your first foe, "Remy The Rat". How will you defeat such a foe?
Once "Remy" is defeated you will have to face an onslaught of foes from Skeletons to Ogres and maybe even The Big Cheese himself.

In your encounters you can choose to attack your enemy directly, block for a chance to rebound half of your enemy's damage back at them, or even heal if you're looking a little low on health.

Will you be able to make your way through the dungeon and beat The Big Cheese??? Only one way to find out I guess.
